            In mathematics, the Hadamard product (also known as the element-wise product, entrywise product[1]: ch. 5  or Schur product[2]) is a binary operation that takes in two matrices of the same dimensions and returns a matrix of the multiplied
             corresponding elements. This operation can be thought as a "naive matrix multiplication" and is different from the matrix product. It is attributed to, and named after, either French-Jewish mathematician Jacques Hadamard or German-Jewish mathematician Issai Schur.

The Hadamard product is associative and distributive. Unlike the matrix product, it is also commutative.[3]
