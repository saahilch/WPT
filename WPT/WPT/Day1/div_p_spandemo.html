        <div style="background-color: blue;color:white">This is div1In                    mathematics, the Hadamard product (also known as the element-wise product, entrywise product[1]: ch. 5  or Schur product[2]) is a binary <span style="background-color: red;color:pink">operation that take</span>s in two matrices of the same dimensions and returns a matrix of the multiplied
            corresponding elements. <p style="background-color: cyan;">This operation can be thought as a "naive matrix multiplication"</p> and is different from the matrix product. It is attributed to, and named after, either French-Jewish mathematician Jacques Hadamard or German-Jewish mathematician Issai Schur.

The Hadamard product is associative and distributive. Unlike the matrix product, it is also commutative.[3]</div>
